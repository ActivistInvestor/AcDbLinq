# AcDbLinq
Classes for accessing, querying and manipulating AutoCAD database objects with Linq.

The scope of AcDbLink will be expanding further. The latest addition is the
RibbonSupport library which was previously exposed as a separate library, but
was merged with AcDbLink because it has a dependence on it.
